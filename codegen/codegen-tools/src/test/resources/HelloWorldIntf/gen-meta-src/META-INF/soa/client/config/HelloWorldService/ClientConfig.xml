                Following section describes the various override options for transport config.
                socket-connect-timeout-msec       The number of milliseconds to wait while opening the socket 
                                                  communication with the service URL. Default to 2000 ms
                socket-read-timeout-msec          The number of milliseconds to wait while reading from Input 
                                                  stream when a connection is established. Default to 3000 ms
                invocation-timeout-msec           The maximum number of milliseconds that an entire transport 
                                                  invocation is allowed to take up. The maximum time allowed 
                                                  for this invocation, including connect, send, and receive.
                                                  Default to 5000 ms
                num-connect-retries               The number of retries to attempt on a connect failure. 
                                                  This is a different parameter from the app-level-num-retries 
                                                  parameter.  Default is 2 retries
                use-detached-local-binding        Indicates whether the local binding operation should be performed 
                                                  in a separate thread or not. Default to false.
                client-streaming                  This flag enables consumer to work in streaming mode in which 
                                                  response data will be downloaded progressively.
                                                  So response will not be downloaded at one strech and this will 
                                                  be useful in case of large attachements. Default to false.

                                            this option can be used to specify which version is the client request 
                                            version for this service. The value is sent via header 
                                            X-TURMERIC-SERVICE-VERSION.  Usually the use-service-version should be the

                                            It is the log level to monitor the client use statistics of this service.
            consumer-id                     It is used to identify the user of service, or to control the access level 
                                            and usage level. A Consumer ID can be obtained for all of Marketplaces, or

        Pipeline framework lies between message processor and the  transport section.
        Following section configures the pipeline handlers, dispatchers, request and response handlers etc.
        request-pipeline           The class that implements interface 
                                   org.ebayopensource.turmeric.runtime.common.pipeline.Pipeline is a driver
                                   for running a message in sequence through configured handlers for a service.
                                   It takes care of handler errors, communication between 
                                   handlers, metric aggregations etc.
        response-pipeline          Similar to request-pipeline except it comes into picture after server 
                                   response is received.
        request-dispatcher         The class that implements 
                                   org.ebayopensource.turmeric.runtime.common.pipeline.Dispatcher is the glue 
                                   that actually invokes a service method passing the java argument objects
        response-dispatcher        Similar to request dispatcher except it gets invoked after the response pipeline 
                                   is invoked.
        request/response-handlers  The handlers are invoked by the pipeline framework. 
                                   Apart from one toplevel handler a chain of handlers can be configured. The 
                                   order of invocation is toplevel handler, and subhandler1, subhandler2 etc  
                                   defined in chain handlers.

       handler-options             The namevalue pairs to support the configuration needs of handlers. The pairs 
                                   are accumulated as hashmaps.
       continue/run-on-error       If the continue-on-error flag is set on the handler that threw the error, the 
                                   exception is stored to a "warning" list in the message context and the current 
                                   processing state (normal / error) is not altered. Otherwise, The exception is 
                                   stored to a critical error list and processing state will be error. Only 
                                   request/response handlers designated as run-on-error in the configuration will 
                                   be invoked. The request dispatcher will not be called.

       logging-handler             One or more logging-handlers that implements 
                                   org.ebayopensource.turmeric.runtime.common.pipeline.LoggingHandler
                                   Logging handlers provide call request/dispatch/response logging capability.
                                   Logging handlers are called at various points in service processing. 
                                   These handlers are distinct from normal pipeline handlers.

        Following section describes the various transport config. 
        Transport config can be for a particular transport type or for all types of transport.

        class-name                        The class should implement interface 
                                          org.ebayopensource.turmeric.runtime.common.pipeline.Transport
        socket-connect-timeout-msec       The number of milliseconds to wait while opening the socket 
                                          communication with the service URL.
        socket-read-timeout-msec          The number of milliseconds to wait while reading from Input 
                                          stream when a connection is established.
        invocation-timeout-msec           The maximum number of milliseconds that an entire transport 
                                          invocation is allowed to take up. The maximum time allowed 
                                          for this invocation, including connect, send, and receive.
        num-connect-retries               The number of retries to attempt on a connect failure.
                                          This is a different parameter from the app-level-num-retries parameter.
        use-detached-local-binding        Indicates whether the local binding operation should be performed 
                                          in a separate thread or not.
        client-streaming                  This flag enables consumer to work in streaming mode in which 
                                          response data will be downloaded progressively.
                                          So response will not be downloaded at one strech and this will 
                                          be useful in case of large attachements.
        other-options                     This options is a name value pair map which helps to override 
                                          the transport options that are meaningful to a specific transport, 
                                          which are not represented explicitly in transport options like 
                                          CONSECUTIVE_FAILURE_THRESHOLD
        header-options                    Header options are name value pair. These header names should be a SOA Header.
                                          These headers are transported as HHTPHeader.
