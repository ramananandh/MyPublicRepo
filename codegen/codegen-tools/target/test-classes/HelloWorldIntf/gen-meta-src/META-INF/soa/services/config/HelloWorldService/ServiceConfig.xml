            unsupported-operation             This allows a service to restrict an operation defined in the 
                                              interface of the service so that it is not invocable. 
                                              This makes pools more manageable by allowing service deployers to 
                                              specifically restrict the operations from among a broadly defined set.
            supported-data-bindings           Allows a service to disallow certain data bindings, e.g. in case 
                                              not all bindings can be tested or in case other constraints exist on 
                                              the use of a particular defined binding.

            version-check-handler             The VersionCheckHandler provides versioning information for a service. 
                                              This is used to test whether an incoming request version is supported

            When using REST (HTTP GET), SOA header values (X-TURMERIC-*) can be inferred based on the URL 
            mapping configuration. This allows the parts of the URL to query string and URL path parameters 
            to X-TURMERIC headers. Apart from mapping the URL mapping section can also configured to not allow 
            certain headers to be a part of the URL. The header mapping options are name value pairs. The name 
            attribute is the valid SOA Header. The value can be one of the following formats.
            path[value]      value is an integer matching one of the "/" separated parts of the URL path, 
                             starting at position 0, for the example "http://localhost:8080/ws/spf/myservice:" 
                             path[0] equals "ws", path[1] equals "spf", and path[2] equals "myservice".

                             If the value starts with '+' symbol like path[+2], then parts are mapped relatively. 
                             i.e. [+1] means no of parts mapped in servlet config plus one
                             Suppose the web.xsl servlet config for service is 
                             _soa_/services/Infrastructure/myservice/v1 ( 5 parts ) and the GET request uri is 
                             _soa_/services/Infrastructure/myservice/v1/myop/myparam ( 7 parts ) then path[+1] 
                             is path[6] maps to "myop" and path[+2] is path[7] maps to myparam

            queryop          Provides the name of the query parameter at the beginning of the query string, 
                             for example, when using ?wsdl, queryop will produce value "wsdl".
                             Ofcourse only one option can have value as queryop.

            query[name]      The name of a query parameter.
                             The corresponding value will be returned; if there are multiple values, 
                             they will be separated by semicolons. 
                             For example, in the query string "?param1=a&param2=b", query[\param2] equals "b".

            reject           Signifies that if the corresponding header is present as part of the URL query string, 
                             the request should be rejected as malformed request.

            Example configs are 
                   <option name="X-TURMERIC-OPERATION-NAME">path[+1]</option>

            Following section allows SOA clients and servers to re-map SOA transport headers to alternative header names 
            or suppress receiving these headers by the server from the client or vice versa. 
            This is required to enable coexistence with non-SOA implementations.
            The values are configured key-value pair where key is the standard SOAHeader name and value could be 
            either suppress (suppress the header from sending to client)
            or of format header[*] where * is any name which indicates that header is transported in the name 
            instead of usual header name.

            The operation mapping feature provides and extra level of dereferencing for specifying 
            the SOA operation name at runtime.
            In other words, this feature will provide the user with the ability to specify an alias for the 
            operation name at runtime. The SOA runtime will do a lookup to find the actual operation name to be 
            invoked for the alias specified with the request.

            For example, if the user has to invoke the operation "getVersion", the GET request would look something like
            http://myserver:8080/MyService?...&X-TURMERIC-OPERATION-NAME=getVersion

            With the operation mapping feature the user can configure the web service's ServiceConfig.xml as below
                       <operation name="getVersion">version</operation>

            Now, the user can specify the request as

        Pipeline framework lies between message processor and the  transport section.

                                   is a driver for running a message in sequence through configured handlers for a service.
                                   It takes care of handler errors, communication between 
                                   handlers, metric aggregations etc.
        response-pipeline          Similar to request-pipeline except it comes into picture after server 
                                   is invoked.
        request/response-handlers  The handlers are invoked by the pipeline framework. 
                                   Apart from one toplevel handler a chain of handlers can be configured. The 
                                   order of invocation is toplevel handler, and subhandler1, subhandler2 etc  
                                   defined in chain handlers.

        handler-options            The namevalue pairs to support the configuration needs of handlers. The pairs 
                                   are accumulated as hashmaps.
        continue/run-on-error      If the continue-on-error flag is set on the handler that threw the error, the 
                                   exception is stored to a "warning" list in the message context and the current 
                                   processing state (normal / error) is not altered. Otherwise, The exception is 
                                   stored to a critical error list and processing state will be error. Only 
                                   request/response handlers designated as run-on-error in the configuration will 
                                   be invoked. The request dispatcher will not be called.

        logging-handler            One or more logging-handlers that implements 
                                   org.ebayopensource.turmeric.runtime.common.pipeline.LoggingHandler
                                   Logging handlers provide call request/dispatch/response logging capability.
                                   Logging handlers are called at various points in service processing. 
                                   These handlers are distinct from normal pipeline handlers.

        Following section allows to override the default databindings configured in the framework or
        to create a new databinding type.
        The default databinding types supported by framework are XML, NV, JSON, FAST_INFOSET

        mime-type                         The MIME type to be used when representing this data binding's 
                                          content type
        serializer-factory-class-name     The class name which implements 
                                          org.ebayopensource.turmeric.runtime.common.binding.SerializerFactory
        deserializer-factory-class-name   The class name which implements 
                                          org.ebayopensource.turmeric.runtime.common.binding.DeserializerFactory.
        options                           options are the name value pair that can be used the 
                                          data-binding-framework. Different data binding defines their
                                          own options that the data binding understand.

        Using options, Schema validation against the request payload at server side can be enabled.
        Following are the two option names (validatePayLoad and schemaValidationHandler) are used to configure.
        validatePayLoad                   If false, The payload would not be validated against the schema,
                                          but the schema gets loaded.
                                          If true, The payload would be validated.

        schemaValidationHandler           The class that should implement javax.xml.bind.ValidationEventHandler.
        For more details, please refer https://www.ebayopensource.org/wiki/display/TURMERICDOC/Schema+Validation

        Here are an example data binding section if custom option values are required.
